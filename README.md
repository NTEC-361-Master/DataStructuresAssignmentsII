# This Assignment

* This is the starter code for the assignments on data structures.
* There are three files. Follow the instructions below for:
- dictionaries.py
- lists.py


# DataStructures

This set of programs is focused on the basic operations common to all data structures. These operations are:
- creation
- element access
- traversal
- element insertion
- element updates
- element deletion
- search
- deletion

This set of programs leads you through simple examples of all these operations in each data structure. This is intended to provide a basis from which you can write your own code. Your own code just combines these operations together to solve a particular problem.

The comments in the program files in this exercise will lead you through a demonstration of each operation for each of the data structures. Read the comments carefully and create your code according to the instructions there. 

Work through the source files one step at a time (**code, run, repeat**).
